TYPE 1 : TYPE OF Learning PROBLEMS

Type  of Learning problems

1.supervised 
2.unsupervised 
3.reinforcement

1)Supervised Learning:-
	In this,using the data, which have taggged data/which has input with correct output,
here we trained the labeled data(both i/p and o/p).

Goal:To predict the output

gives accurate results than unsupervised
	
it has two methods:1)Regression and 2) classification.
Regresssion have continuous values while classification have categorical data in target value.

it taking more computational time

2)Unsupervised Learning:-
	In this,no labeled data is there.Pattern are infronted from unlabeled data,

Goal:To find hidden pattern will find from data

it is close to AI 

it has two methods:clustering and association

2--    2    yes  yes   yes   no    yes         bag1
2--    2    yes  yes   yes   no    yes         bag2
2--    2    yes  yes   yes   no    yes         bag1
2--    2    yes  yes   yes   no    yes         bag2

3)Reinforcement Learning:

Reward/Punishment after each action in envrionment --- No labeled data

e.g.Robotics,Games
